This mod adds all kinds of commands to the terminal each of these commands can be disabled in the config file. 

Currently they are listed under the "other" command in Terminal.

This mod currently depends on TerminalAPI (minimum version: 1.5.0), this should however be installed automatically.

If you encounter any bugs you can report them on the project github: https://github.com/Beauver/ExtraTerminalCommands
